== PURPOSE ==

The univie-ling bundle provides LaTeX2e classes suitable for student papers,
PhD research proposals (Exposés) and theses in (Applied) Linguistics at the
University of Vienna. The classes implement some standards for these types of text
(such as a suitable title page). They are particularly suited for the field of
(Applied) Linguistics and pre-load some packages that are considered useful in
this disciplinary context. The classes might also be used for General and Historical
Linguistics as well as for other fields of study at Vienna University.
In this case, however, some settings might have to be adjusted.

Furthermore, the bundle includes a class for the Department's house journal,
Wiener Linguistische Gazette (WLG).
